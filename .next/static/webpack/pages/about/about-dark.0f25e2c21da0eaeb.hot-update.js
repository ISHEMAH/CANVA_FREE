We start with the early days of rule-based systems and expert systems, progressing to the advent of machine learning and its various algorithms. The spotlight then shifts to the transformative impact of neural networks, exploring their role in powering deep learning models and their applications in image recognition, natural language processing, and more. As AI continues to advance, we\'ll explore the challenges, ethical considerations, and the potential future developments that await us in the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence.","image":"/img/blog/b2.jpg","tags":["WordPress","Themeforest","Vie"],"date":{"day":"28","month":"January","year":"2023"}}]');
